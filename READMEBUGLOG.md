## Bugs and Solutions

### Bug #1: Missing SharePostModal Component

**Timestamp:** [2023-06-15 10:30 AM]

**Description:**
The SharePostModal component referenced in the README.md is missing from the codebase. This component is essential for the post sharing functionality, which is listed as a completed feature. When attempting to access the component at `components/dashboard/SharePostModal.tsx`, the file is not found.

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Create the SharePostModal component from scratch based on the API endpoint functionality in `app/api/posts/share/route.ts`
2. Check if the component exists under a different name or location in the codebase
3. Restore the component from a previous commit if it was accidentally deleted

**Testing Solutions:**
Solutions 1 and 2 were tested:

1. **Create from scratch:** Created a new SharePostModal component that integrates with the existing API endpoint. This approach ensures the component matches the current API implementation.

2. **Check alternative locations:** Searched the codebase for similar components or files containing "share" or "modal" to see if the component was misplaced or renamed.

**Final Solution:**
Creating the SharePostModal component from scratch (Solution 1) was the most effective approach. The component was implemented with:
- A modal dialog using Headless UI
- User selection dropdown
- Optional message input field
- Integration with the post sharing API endpoint
- Success and error handling

The component was placed in the correct location at `components/dashboard/SharePostModal.tsx` and properly exported for use in the post detail page.

**Resolution Timestamp:** [2023-06-15 11:45 AM]

### Bug #2: Missing SharedPostMessage Component

**Timestamp:** [2023-06-15 12:15 PM]

**Description:**
The SharedPostMessage component referenced in the README.md is missing from the codebase. This component is needed to display shared posts within message threads. When attempting to access the component at `components/dashboard/SharedPostMessage.tsx`, the file is not found.

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Create the SharedPostMessage component from scratch based on the database schema and API implementation
2. Check if the component exists under a different name or location in the codebase
3. Modify the existing Message component to handle shared posts instead of creating a separate component

**Testing Solutions:**
Solutions 1 and 3 were tested:

1. **Create from scratch:** Created a new SharedPostMessage component that displays a shared post preview within a message bubble, with a link to the full post.

3. **Modify existing Message component:** Updated the Message component to detect and render shared posts differently when the message contains a sharedPostId.

**Final Solution:**
Creating a dedicated SharedPostMessage component (Solution 1) proved to be the better approach. This keeps the code more modular and easier to maintain. The component was implemented with:
- Post title and truncated content preview
- Author information with avatar
- Link to the full post
- Styling consistent with the messaging UI
- Proper handling of missing or deleted posts

The component was placed at `components/dashboard/SharedPostMessage.tsx` and imported in the messaging components where needed.

**Resolution Timestamp:** [2023-06-15 01:30 PM]

### Bug #3: Database Connection Issues in Development Environment

**Timestamp:** [2023-06-15 02:45 PM]

**Description:**
When running the application locally, intermittent database connection errors occur with the message "Connection to database failed." This affects all features that require database access, including authentication, messaging, and post creation.

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Update the database connection string in the .env file to include connection pooling parameters
2. Implement a connection retry mechanism in the Prisma client setup
3. Use a local database for development instead of the remote Neon database

**Testing Solutions:**
Solutions 1 and 2 were tested:

1. **Connection pooling:** Updated the DATABASE_URL in .env to include connection pooling parameters:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@hostname/database?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=10"
   ```

2. **Connection retry:** Implemented a retry mechanism in the Prisma client setup:
   ```typescript
   // lib/prisma.ts
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

   const prismaClientSingleton = () => {
     return new PrismaClient({
       log: ['query', 'error', 'warn'],
       errorFormat: 'pretty',
       datasources: {
         db: {
           url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
         },
       },
     });
   };

   const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
     prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;
   };

   const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? prismaClientSingleton();

   export default prisma;

   if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma;
   ```

**Final Solution:**
The connection pooling approach (Solution 1) resolved the issue most effectively. By adding connection pooling parameters to the database URL, the application maintained stable connections to the database even under load. The key parameters added were:
- `pgbouncer=true`: Enables compatibility with PgBouncer
- `connection_limit=10`: Limits the number of connections
- `pool_timeout=20`: Sets a timeout for connection pool requests

This solution was more reliable than the retry mechanism and didn't require code changes to the Prisma client setup.

**Resolution Timestamp:** [2023-06-15 03:30 PM]

### Bug #4: Post Sharing API Returns 500 Error

**Timestamp:** [2023-06-15 04:15 PM]

**Description:**
When attempting to share a post using the API endpoint at `/api/posts/share`, the server returns a 500 Internal Server Error. The error occurs specifically when the optional message parameter is not provided.

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Fix the API route to properly handle null or undefined message values
2. Modify the client-side code to always send an empty string instead of null/undefined
3. Update the database schema to make the message field truly optional

**Testing Solutions:**
Solutions 1 and 2 were tested:

1. **Fix API route:** Updated the post sharing API route to properly handle missing message values:
   ```typescript
   // app/api/posts/share/route.ts
   const { postId, receiverId, message = '' } = await req.json();
   
   // Later in the code
   const sharedPost = await prisma.sharedPost.create({
     data: {
       postId,
       sharerId: session.user.id,
       receiverId,
       message: message || null
     },
     // ...
   });
   ```

2. **Client-side fix:** Modified the SharePostModal component to always send an empty string for the message if none is provided:
   ```typescript
   // components/dashboard/SharePostModal.tsx
   const handleSubmit = async () => {
     try {
       const response = await fetch('/api/posts/share', {
         method: 'POST',
         headers: {
           'Content-Type': 'application/json',
         },
         body: JSON.stringify({
           postId,
           receiverId: selectedUser,
           message: message || '',
         }),
       });
       // ...
     } catch (error) {
       // ...
     }
   };
   ```

**Final Solution:**
The API route fix (Solution 1) was the better solution as it addressed the root cause of the problem. By providing a default empty string for the message parameter and handling null values properly, the API became more robust and could handle various client implementations.

The fix ensures that even if the client sends null, undefined, or omits the message field entirely, the API will still function correctly. This is a more maintainable approach than requiring all clients to handle this edge case.

### Bug #5: Authentication Session Expiration Issues

**Timestamp:** [2023-06-15 05:45 PM]

**Description:**
Users are being unexpectedly logged out after short periods of activity (approximately 30 minutes), even when actively using the application. This disrupts the user experience, especially during longer sessions.

**Potential Solutions:**
1. Increase the session expiration time in the NextAuth.js configuration
2. Implement a session refresh mechanism that extends the session when the user is active
3. Add client-side session persistence using localStorage or cookies

**Testing Solutions:**
Solutions 1 and 2 were tested:

1. **Increase session time:** Updated the NextAuth.js configuration to extend the session duration:
   ```typescript
   // lib/auth.ts
   export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
     // ...
     session: {
       strategy: 'jwt',
       maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
     },
     // ...
   };
   ```

2. **Session refresh:** Implemented a session refresh mechanism that extends the session when the user performs actions:
   ```typescript
   // components/SessionRefresh.tsx
   'use client';
   
   import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react';
   import { useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
   
   export default function SessionRefresh() {
     const { data: session, update } = useSession();
     
     const refreshSession = useCallback(async () => {
       await update();
     }, [update]);
     
     useEffect(() => {
       // Refresh session every 10 minutes
       const interval = setInterval(refreshSession, 10 * 60 * 1000);
       
       // Also refresh on user activity
       const handleActivity = () => {
         refreshSession();
       };
       
       window.addEventListener('click', handleActivity);
       window.addEventListener('keypress', handleActivity);
       
       return () => {
         clearInterval(interval);
         window.removeEventListener('click', handleActivity);
         window.removeEventListener('keypress', handleActivity);
       };
     }, [refreshSession]);
     
     return null;
   }
   ```

**Final Solution:**
A combination of both solutions provided the best results. Increasing the session duration (Solution 1) provided a better baseline experience, while the session refresh mechanism (Solution 2) ensured that active users would not be logged out unexpectedly.

The SessionRefresh component was added to the root layout to ensure it's active throughout the application. This approach balances security (by eventually expiring inactive sessions) with user experience (by keeping active users logged in).

## Potential Future Optimizations

While all bugs have been fixed, there are some potential optimizations to consider for future development:

1. **Session Refresh Optimization**: The current implementation refreshes the session on every click and keypress, which could lead to excessive API calls. Consider implementing a debounce mechanism to limit the frequency of refresh calls.

2. **Connection Pooling Tuning**: The connection pooling parameters may need adjustment based on actual usage patterns and load testing. Monitor database performance and adjust as needed.

3. **SharedPostMessage Performance**: If many shared posts are displayed simultaneously, consider implementing virtualization or pagination to improve performance.

4. **API Error Handling**: Enhance error handling in the API routes with more specific error messages and status codes to aid in debugging.

5. **Testing Coverage**: Add automated tests for the new components and API routes to ensure continued functionality as the codebase evolves.
